Introduction to Bayesian Linear Regression: An explanation of the Bayesian approach to linear modeling
(bayesian vs frequentist argument - argues to learn both approaches, look at advantages/disadvantages of both and choose accordingly)

recap of frequentist linear regression
 theory/methodology
 example on real world data

Simple and Multipe Linear Regression in Python
Quick introduction to linear regression in Python

Intro
-previous work / plugs
-what we are doing in this post
-how this post fits in with future posts
-what precisely we are doing, item by item in this post
-what is 'main topic', definition and explanation

A little bit about the math

Linear Regression in Python
-Linear Regresion in Statsmodels
--use real world dataset, some exploration done
-Linear regression in sklearn
--use same real world dataset

Conclusion

Introduction to Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression
Build your own model from scratch

Intro/discussion

What is Linear regression??
- graphics/gifs posted
- what is regression
- simple linear regression

Cost Function

Gradient Descent
- objective
- basic idea
- graphic
- expanation/analogy, parameters and their explanations

Code
- details on which method we will use (sklearn and scratch)
- more graphics and gifs
- real world dataset brought in
- visualization of what the data looks like in the dataset
- the sklearn method and a small amount of detail of what the code is doing
- print out r2 as supposed measure of accuracy of model
- gradient descent method and details about what its doing/code
- print out of r2 as supposed mesuare of acc of model
- visualization of regression lines over dataset

Conclusion(weak)
- importance of LR for ML enthusiasts
- comment about its usefullness
- trivial courtesy

General Model Template I've Decided on:

(INTRO    :tell them what you will tell them, 
BODY      :tell them, 
CONCLUSION:tell them what you told them)

1. Decide on a topic area
2. Decide on a main point/thesis to argue for, and/or main objective(s) of the blog post
3. Do Research and draw up a scope for the blogpost
- what are my options for important information to include
- what of that information will I actually include and how does it fit in the grand scheme of my main point/thesis
4. Start with the Body Sections
- based on the main point/thesis, what sections will the body include? (section name, (objective)purpose of the section vs main point, math that will be included, basic idea,  graphics/visualizations that will be included, explanation/analogy and deeper detail
5. Determine an appropriate real world dataset to use for the post
-find it
-reference it at the end in references
-do some exploratory analysis for it as you introduce it
6. Write up the references/sources section
7. Write up the conclusion/discussion section for the end
8. Write up the introduction (based on main point/thesis)

-----------------------------

1. Topic Area = Simple Linear Regression / Univariate LR
2. main point / thesis / main objectives
- To give the reader both a basic and advanced understanding of the inner workings of linear regression
- To give the reader theory/methodology to construct Linear Regression from scratch (direct, qr, svd, sklearn, gd, cov) in python
- To give the reader the tools/skills necessary to decide which linear regression method is best to use for their specific real world dataset
- 

8. Introduction
- intro discussion
- in general, what our main point / thesis is for this topic
- "After completing this tutorial you will know..."
