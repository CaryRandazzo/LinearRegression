##### **Simple Linear Regression: 6 Methods from Scratch in Python with Example Use Case Study**
- What is SLR?
  
- How does it work? (An overview that includes the introduction of the term 'estimation techniques'
  - the theory
  - Estimation Techniques- Estimation Techniques
  - the dataset
  - visual explanation
  
- Method 1 - the Linear Algebra Method
  (metholdology goes here)
  
- Method 2 - the QR Decomposition Method
  (metholdology goes here)(metholdology goes here)  https://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/qr_and_regression.htmlhttps://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/qr_and_regression.html
  
- Method 3 - the SVD Decomposition Method
  (metholdology goes here)(metholdology goes here)
  
- Method 4 - the Gradient Descent Method
  
- Method 5 - the Sklearn Method
  
- Method 6 - the Covariance Method
  
- Which to use when?
  
- Example Case Study
  (choose a dataset, determine which is best SLR method to use, make sure the dataset is of single feature data..maybe impact data from accelerometer, maybe something more common, maybe particle physics data)
  (use the following link as a resource of what you might want to include on your analysis: http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/, also make sure to include exploratory analysis, data cleaning, etc..but do not include things outside of the scope of the tutorial ...stick to 'choosing the right slr method for this case study' and 'use of that slr method in this analysis' primarily...use heavy use of visualizations etc to craft a solid argument about the analysis...readup on analysis stuff to present this properly)
  
NOTE: The following topics/subtopics are outside of the scope of this blogpost...
- tuning the $\alpha$ parameter (a quick argument for what to choose and how can be added in the SLR Method 4 section)
- optimization and execution time analysis (a quick plot showing the comparison without methodology, deep description etc. to aid the audience can be included)
  
  
**FINAL NOTE**
1. Make sure to do the writing, storytelling, and explanatory part of the post SEPARATE from the development/coding of the post.
2. Make sure the coding for the post is done without the use of double dollar signs because it will not render properly in the wordpress latex system. Ditto for using the \limits command in latex, it doesnt work.
3. Make sure to review how to write the latex code edits to go from jupyter notebooks latex to wordpress latex - consider writing a script to process the json file as needed for the final uploading to wordpress blog
4. Make any hand edits necessary and consider updating the processor code to handle any new procedures that need to be processed all at once in a script in the future (see 3)
